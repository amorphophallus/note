## Events and Probabilities

1. definitions
    - frequency: $F_N(A)=\frac{n}{N}$
    - probability: $$P(A) = \lim_{N\to +\infty} F_{N}(A)$$
    - sample point: $\omega$ an event that can't be decomposed into some combination of other events. 
    - sample space: $\Omega$ The set of all sample points.
    - event: $A, B, C...$ a certain subset of the sample space.
    - probability space:
        - $\sigma$-algebra $$
2. models
    - classical probability models: finite sample space & equal possibility
    - geometric probability models:
